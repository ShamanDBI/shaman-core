# How do I use your tool?

In this document I have documented all the possible use cases I am thinking of it can be use.

1. Intercepting File Descriptor Operations
1. Anti-Debug Bypasses
    1. Trace ptrace related system calls and block them
1. Code Coverage Tracing and Reporting
    1. This will cover both senarios one were you have access to source code and where you don't have acess.
1. Programmatic Breakpoint Handling
1. Tracing Data accross different process
    1. This will be achieved by Programmatic breakpoint but on different Process.
